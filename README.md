# Helix-Vortex-Spiral-Engine
Revolutionary Helix-Vortex Spiral Combustion Engine designed using Leap 71 Noyron computational engineering. Triple-helix combustion chambers with biomimetic lattice structures, conformal cooling, and zero-assembly monolithic 3D printing. 38% lighter, 40% more efficient, and visually unlike anything the world has seen before.
